		<p class="testimony">"The law library is in terrible shape. Currently, there are two working computers, (three are not working). These computers allow access to Lexisnexis software, but you cannot download any cases from the Lexis for use on your personal word processor. Hard copies of cases cost ten cents per page. The computers do not have any word processor program. Paralegals do not readily assist inmates; In fact, paralegals work in an area that is separated from the law library. Basically, Rahway's Law Library is a self service operation with very limited resources."</p>

		<p class="testimony">"In 2013...I was attacked by a cellmate. He threw hot water on me which caused serious burns. After the hot water was thrown on me, I was taken to a hospital outside the prison. [When I returned] I was placed in a detention cell...an isolated 'dry cell' in the prison infirmary. In this cell, there was no bed, only a 2 or 3 inch mattress on the floor. There was no other furniture. As for fixtures, there was a sink connected to a toilet, but the toilet was flushed from outside the cell. The cell itself was filthy, with dry feces smeared on the walls. My teeth were chattering and I was trembling, that's how cold it was. Eventually, I was given two sheets and a blanket which provided little protection from the cold."</p>

		<p class="testimony">From someone reporting on another prisoner in 2EE, a mental health/special needs unit: "R., who was on constant watch to prevent suicide, was challenged to a fight by a CO.  The CO went into his cell and assaulted (him), without provocation."<br /><br />R was placed on 7 wing, in a disciplinary segregation unit. R was not charged, which is unusual under the circumstance. Prisoners report that assaults by corrections officers are often covered up, by calling a suicide code to justify entering a cell without supervision by a Sgt., assaulting a prisoner and then issuing an assault code to justify the prisoner-victim's injuries., The alleged assault by the prisoner-victim then becomes the basis for a disciplinary charges against the prisoner-victim, who is subject to a kangaroo court hearing, sanctioned, and then placed in  a non-mental health solitary confinement cell, without the proper clinician screening required by the Department's regulations.</p>
